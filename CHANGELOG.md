### Fixed - 2025-10-23 - Database Integration & Navigation

#### Fixed

- ✅ **Dashboard components broken** - Fixed routes and field mappings
  - Removed QuickActions component (redundant with list view + buttons)
  - Fixed RecentChapters: Updated routes to `/cards/chapters` and field names to `chapter.name` and `chapter.id`
  - Fixed RecentScenes: Updated route to `/cards/scenes/edit/[id]` for direct edit access
  - Both recent components now click through to edit pages correctly
  - ProjectStats already using correct `db` methods
  - Files: `apps/front/src/lib/components/dashboard/*.svelte`

- ✅ **Chapters list view showing wrong fields** - Fixed field mapping
  - Changed from `chapter.title || chapter.chapterId` to `chapter.name || chapter.title || chapter.id`
  - Changed from `chapter.chapterId` to `chapter.id` for ID display
  - Now correctly displays chapter name and ID from backend
  - File: `apps/front/src/routes/cards/chapters/+page.svelte:70-73`

- ✅ **List views not refreshing** - Added `afterNavigate()` hook to reload data after navigation
  - Problem: SvelteKit client-side navigation cached old data when returning from edit pages
  - Solution: Extracted load logic into `loadChapters()`/`loadScenes()` functions called from both `onMount()` and `afterNavigate()`
  - Affected files: `apps/front/src/routes/cards/chapters/+page.svelte`, `apps/front/src/routes/cards/scenes/+page.svelte`
  - Now lists automatically refresh when navigating back from create/edit pages

- ✅ **Chapter edit page missing** - Created chapter edit functionality
  - Added `/cards/chapter/edit/+page.svelte` with ID, name, and description fields
  - Chapter ID displayed as read-only (cannot be changed after creation)
  - Redirects to chapters list after successful save

- ✅ **Chapter dropdown empty in scene editor** - Fixed ChapterSelect component
  - Updated to use `db.getAllChapters()` instead of old `getChapters()` from dataClient
  - Fixed field mapping: using `c.id` and `c.name || c.title || c.id` to display chapter names
  - File: `apps/cards/src/components/ChapterSelect.svelte`

- ✅ **API response format inconsistency** - Added dual-format support in API client
  - Problem: Backend returns both `{id, data: "json"}` format and direct JSON depending on endpoint
  - Solution: Added format detection in `getChapter()` and `getScene()` methods
  - Checks if `response.data` is string → parse with `parseDataField()`, otherwise use directly
  - File: `apps/shared/src/api-client.ts:155-171`

- ✅ **Chapter creation validation** - Added auto-prefix and C identifier validation
  - Backend requires chapter IDs to start with "chapter" and follow C naming rules
  - Frontend now auto-prefixes with "chapter_" if user doesn't include it
  - Validates format: only letters, numbers, and underscores allowed
  - File: `apps/front/src/routes/cards/chapter/new/+page.svelte:25-37`

#### Changed

- ✅ **Replaced emoji icons with Lucide** - Migrated from emoji to proper SVG icons
  - Installed `lucide-svelte` package in frontend
  - Replaced ➕ with `<Plus>` icon component
  - Replaced 📚 with `<BookOpen>` icon (64px for empty states)
  - Replaced 📄 with `<FileText>` icon (64px for empty states)
  - Updated buttons to use `inline-flex items-center gap-2` for proper icon alignment
  - Affected files: chapters and scenes list views

#### Refactored

- ✅ **Unified data access layer** - Removed redundant wrappers, use `db` singleton directly
  - Removed `apps/cards/src/lib/dataClient.ts` - was just pass-through to `db`
  - Removed `apps/front/src/lib/dataStore.ts` - unnecessary Svelte store wrapper
  - All components now import `db` directly from `@loke/shared/database`
  - Simplified `apps/front/src/routes/+layout.ts` - no init needed
  - Cleaner architecture with single source of truth

- ✅ **Standardized routing structure** - Migrated to RESTful route conventions
  - **Old routes** (inconsistent):
    - `/cards/editor?id=X` → Scene edit (query param)
    - `/cards/scene/new` → Scene create
    - `/cards/chapter/new` → Chapter create
    - `/cards/chapter/edit?id=X` → Chapter edit (query param)
  - **New routes** (RESTful):
    - `/cards/scenes/edit/[id]` → Scene edit (URL param)
    - `/cards/scenes/new` → Scene create
    - `/cards/chapters/new` → Chapter create
    - `/cards/chapters/edit/[id]` → Chapter edit (URL param)
  - Benefits:
    - Consistent REST pattern across all resources
    - Clean URLs without query parameters
    - Better SvelteKit integration with `$page.params.id`
    - Improved SEO and bookmarkability
  - Updated all internal links in list views to use new routes

### Added - 2025-10-23 - Custom SVG Icon System

#### Added

- ✅ **Custom SVG icon system** - Replaced external icon libraries with local SVG components
  - Created `packages/ui/src/icons/` directory with 7 Lucide-based SVG icons
  - Icons: FileText, File, BookOpen, PenTool, Plus, List, LayoutDashboard, Settings
  - Each icon wrapped as Svelte component with `{...$$props}` for flexibility
  - Removed dependency on external icon packages (@lucide/svelte, lucide-svelte, lucide)

#### Fixed

- ✅ **Icon import crashes** - Fixed "Unknown file extension .svelte" and module resolution errors
  - Problem: External icon libraries had Svelte 5 compatibility issues
  - Solution: Downloaded SVG icons directly from Lucide and created local Svelte components
  - Updated imports in `apps/cards/src/menu.ts` and `packages/ui/src/components/AppSidebar.svelte`
  - All menu items now render correctly with SVG icons instead of emojis

#### Icon Usage Policy

- ✅ **Established icon policy** - Use custom SVG icons, not ASCII or emoji
  - All new UI components should use icons from `packages/ui/src/icons/`
  - Icons are fully customizable with Tailwind classes (size, color, stroke-width)
  - Consistent 24x24 viewBox with stroke-based design matching Tailwind aesthetic
  - Easy to extend: download new SVG from Lucide and create .svelte component

#### Files Added

- `packages/ui/src/icons/FileText.svelte` - Document icon
- `packages/ui/src/icons/File.svelte` - File icon
- `packages/ui/src/icons/BookOpen.svelte` - Book icon

### Refactoring - 2025-10-22 - Simplification of Svelte Architecture

**MAJOR CLEANUP**: Removed over-engineered complexity from Svelte port

#### Removed

- ❌ **Removed `workers/` directory entirely**
  - Deleted `workers/data/` with Comlink-based Web Worker implementation
  - Web Workers were overkill for simple CRUD operations on localStorage
  - No heavy computation that justified worker overhead

- ❌ **Removed `packages/worker-client/` package**
  - Only 14 lines of Comlink wrapper code
  - Unnecessary abstraction layer removed

- ❌ **Removed all Comlink dependencies and imports (27+ references)**
  - `apps/front/package.json` - removed `comlink` and `@loke/worker-client` deps
  - `apps/graph/package.json` - removed `comlink` and `@loke/worker-client` deps
  - Replaced all `Comlink.wrap()` calls with direct `db.*` calls
  - Files updated: 10+ components across front/, cards/, graph/

- ❌ **Removed worker integration test**
  - `apps/front/tests/worker.integration.test.ts` deleted

#### Changed

- ✅ **Simplified workspace configuration**
  - `package.json` workspaces reduced from 7 to 6
  - Before: `["cards", "shared", "apps/*", "workers/*", "packages/*"]`
  - After: `["apps/*", "packages/*"]`

- ✅ **Consolidated database layer to single implementation**
  - All data operations now use `apps/shared/src/database.ts`
  - Simple localStorage-backed Database class (no workers, no Comlink)
  - Singleton pattern: `export const db = new Database()`
  - In-memory Maps + localStorage persistence

- ✅ **Updated all components to use direct database calls**
  - Before: `const worker = new SharedWorker(...); const api = Comlink.wrap(worker.port); await api.cards.list()`
  - After: `import { db } from '@loke/shared/database'; await db.getAllScenes()`
  - Components updated:
    - `apps/front/src/lib/dataStore.ts`
    - `apps/front/src/lib/components/dashboard/RecentChapters.svelte`
    - `apps/front/src/lib/components/dashboard/RecentScenes.svelte`
    - `apps/front/src/lib/components/dashboard/ProjectStats.svelte`
    - `apps/front/src/lib/components/ChapterManager.svelte`
    - `apps/cards/src/lib/dataClient.ts`
    - `apps/cards/src/routes/scenes/+page.svelte`
    - `apps/cards/src/components/SceneEditorView.svelte`

- ✅ **Fixed package exports for micro-frontends**
  - `apps/shared/package.json` - Added subpath exports for `./database`, `./types`, `./utils`
  - `apps/cards/package.json` - Added `main` and `exports` fields
  - `apps/graph/package.json` - Added `main` and `exports` fields

- ✅ **Updated Vite configuration**
  - `apps/front/vite.config.js` - Removed worker build config
  - Removed dead `@workers-data`, `@shared`, `@apps-cards` aliases
  - Added clean `@loke/apps-cards`, `@loke/apps-graph`, `@loke/shared` aliases
  - Simplified build rollupOptions (removed worker input)

- ✅ **Fixed menu architecture**
  - `packages/ui/src/components/AppSidebar.svelte` - Updated imports to `@loke/apps-cards` and `@loke/apps-graph`
  - Menu items now properly imported dynamically from feature modules
  - Cards and Graph modules export their own menu definitions

#### Architecture Improvements

**Before (Over-engineered):**

```
Browser → Comlink → SharedWorker → In-memory Maps → (no persistence)
         (27 imports)  (worker.ts)
```

**After (Simple & Direct):**

```
Browser → Database class → localStorage
         (direct calls)    (persistent)
```

**Benefits:**

- 🚀 Faster - No worker message passing overhead
- 🧹 Simpler - 27 fewer Comlink imports
- 📦 Smaller - 2 fewer packages in monorepo
- 🔧 Maintainable - Direct function calls, easier to debug
- 💾 Persistent - Data survives page refresh (localStorage)

#### Documentation

- ✅ **Updated README.md** with new architecture
  - Documented micro-frontend design principle
  - Added "Key Design Principle" section explaining menu ownership
  - Updated technology stack (removed Comlink, Workers, LocalForage)
  - Clarified folder structure and responsibilities
  - Added "Removed Complexity" section

#### Testing

- ✅ **Verified pnpm install succeeds** (2.6s, 773 packages)
- ✅ **Backend server compiles and runs** (port 3000)
- ✅ **Frontend server starts** (port 5183)
- ⚠️ **Menu integration pending** (alias configuration complete, runtime testing needed)

### Added - 2025-10-22

- **pnpm Setup & Workspace Configuration**: Installed pnpm v10.19.0 as package manager and configured monorepo workspace
- **Fixed Workspace Dependencies**: Created missing `@loke/shared` package with basic types and utilities
- **Updated Project Structure**: Fixed `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to properly include all workspace packages (`apps/*`, `packages/*`, `workers/*`)
- **Package Dependencies**: Successfully installed 690 packages across 9 workspace projects
- **Development Scripts**: Updated README.md with comprehensive pnpm-based development commands

### Added - 2025-10-22

- Phase 2 Dashboard Implementation: Complete dashboard with Quick Actions, Project Stats, Recent Chapters, and Recent Scenes components
- Dashboard integrated into main route (`/`) replacing placeholder content
- Components use existing data worker API and follow established patterns
- Responsive grid layout with loading states and error handling
- Navigation links to existing routes for chapters and scenes management

### Added - 2025-10-21

- Phase 1 scaffolding: added `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and placeholder packages under `apps/`, `workers/`, and `packages/` (no new runtime deps installed yet).
- App shell layout aligned to scrollable-main pattern in `cards`.
- Unit test: `ThemeToggle` toggles dark mode and persists preference.
- Root scripts: `test:tdd` (Vitest watch via cards workspace) and `test:e2e:ui` (Playwright UI).
- Phase 2 (data worker): Comlink-based SharedWorker RPC (`ping`, `cards.*`, `chapters.*`) with Zod schemas in `packages/schemas`; client updated; test routes (`/worker-test`, `/worker-cards`, `/worker-cards-crud`, `/worker-chapters`) and E2E specs added.

### Added - 2025-10-21

- Scaffolded Svelte migration (Part 2): created new workspaces `cards` (Svelte app) and `shared` (Svelte library) alongside existing Vue packages.
- Implemented minimal shared components and UI store in `shared` (`AppHeader`, `AppSidebar`, `AppModal`, `ui.store`).
- Initialized SvelteKit in `cards` (svelte.config.js, Vite kit plugin, app.html) with minimal layout and home page reusing Tailwind styles.
- Updated Tailwind content globs to include Svelte sources; added root scripts to run Svelte app via workspaces.
- Ported `shared-vue` to Svelte equivalents in `shared` (components: BaseButton, BaseInput, BaseSkeletonList, NavLink, SidebarMenu, ThemeToggle, NetworkToggle, StatusPill, ProjectPicker; stores: ui, sync, project, toast; libs: events, validation, storage).
- Svelte app routes scaffolded: home, scenes list, chapters list, new scene/chapter forms, settings, story map (toc), and C code placeholder. Header includes status/network/theme/project; sidebar uses drawer menu.
- Scene editor page scaffolded at `/scene/[id]` with basic edit/save via offline storage.
- Shared API client scaffolded in `shared/src/lib/api/client.ts` with force-offline toggle and JSON helpers; exported via `@shared`.

### Docs - 2025-10-21

- README: Added migration note highlighting Svelte as the active app and documenting how to run legacy Vue apps optionally.
- AGENTS.md: Added “Legacy Vue Artifacts” section clarifying that `cards-vue`, `graph-vue`, and `shared-vue` are read‑only and excluded from the toolchain, plus quick commands.
- AGENTS.md: Added Language Policy (pure TS in `cards/` and `shared/`, server in C/C++ only) and CI rules.

### Tooling - 2025-10-21

- Enabled TypeScript strict mode for `cards/` and `shared/` (`tsconfig.json`).
- Added CI scripts: `check:types`, `check:svelte`, `check:ts-purity`, and aggregate `ci`.

### Refactoring - 2025-10-21

- **Project Restructuring (Phase 1):** (Gemini)
  - Restructured the project into a monorepo-like layout to prepare for Svelte migration.
  - Created `cards-vue`, `graph-vue`, and `shared-vue` directories.
  - Relocated the main Vue application source from the root (`src/`, `tests/`, `index.html`) into the `cards-vue` directory.
  - Relocated the graph application from `apps/graph` into the `graph-vue` directory.
  - Cleaned up the root directory by removing the now-obsolete `src/`, `apps/`, and `tests/` folders.

### Planning

- Reorder roadmap: Phase 7 → PWA Offline‑First + Sync; Phase 8 → Deployment
- Add SYNC design doc: `doc/SYNC-DESIGN.md` (single‑user LWW, push/pull deltas)
- Projects layer: introduce `projectStore` + `ProjectPicker` (single active project)

### Phase 7 - Offline‑First Bootstrap - 2025-10-20

### Added

- Sync heartbeat that live‑checks backend health every 2s and updates UI
  - `src/plugins/sync-heartbeat.js`, wired from `src/main.js`
- Network toggle for manual Online/Offline simulation (persists in `localStorage`)
  - `src/components/NetworkToggle.vue`; placed next to `StatusPill`
- Sync store with basic states: `synced`, `syncing`, `idle`, `offline`, `error`
  - `src/stores/syncStore.js` and `StatusPill` wiring with pending count
- Service Worker scaffold (app‑shell/runtime caching; prod/preview only)
  - Registration in `src/main.js`; worker in `public/sw.js`
- Playwright scaffold for offline app‑shell navigation (skipped until finalized)
  - `tests/offline-sync.spec.js`
- Reactive data stores (live UI updates)
  - `src/stores/scenes.js` and `src/stores/chapters.js` as single source of truth (Pinia)
  - Lists and editors bind to store state; background refresh replaces content only if non-empty
  - Event bus for cross-tab updates: `src/lib/events.js`, wired in `src/lib/storage.js`
- DB adapter + WASM path
  - `src/lib/db/` with `getDb()` switchable between LocalForage and SQL.js (WASM); Worker-capable
  - SQL.js OPFS persistence (autosave + manual flush), Settings UI to switch and migrate

### Changed

- API client normalization and canonical data shape
  - Scenes now normalized to a single shape in the app: `sceneId` (primary id), `id` mirrors `sceneId`, `chapterId` holds chapter reference
  - `api.scenes.getAll/getById` return normalized objects; `api.chapters.getAll` normalized as well
  - `api.scenes.create/update` accept canonical fields and add `id`/`chapter` aliases for backend compatibility
  - Central normalizers added: `src/lib/normalize.js`
  - App consistency updates using canonical fields
  - Editor/List/Dashboard/Graph use `sceneId` and `chapterId` exclusively in UI and logic
  - Removed ad‑hoc normalization in views; rely on API client/utility normalizers
  - Graph app aligned: API client and store now normalize to canonical `sceneId`/`chapterId` (internal `id` mirrors `sceneId`)
  - Scene/Chapter lists and Dashboard now use stores and update live without reload
  - Settings exposes Database Backend controls and migration utility
  - Scene/Chapter lists and Dashboard now use stores and update live without reload

### Upcoming — Projects (Single Active Project)

### Added

- `projectStore` (planned): holds `currentProject`, list, CRUD; persists selection in `localStorage`.
- `ProjectPicker` (planned): header/sidebar dropdown for selecting the active project; Settings for project management.

### Changed

- Scope all Cards views (lists, editors) and operations by `projectId` (planned migration of existing data to `projectId: 'default'`).
- API: include optional `projectId` filter and payload fields; keep backward compatible.
- Graph app uses the same project context as Cards (viewer role):
  - Reads active `projectId` (shared key or API param) and only displays that project’s chapters/scenes.
  - No independent project selection in Graph when embedded; follows Cards.

### Database/API compatibility (IDs)

- No server DB schema changes in this phase (still: `chapters(id TEXT, data TEXT)`, `scenes(id TEXT, data TEXT)`).
- Canonical scene shape for clients (recommended):
  - `sceneId` — primary scene identifier (string). Also set `id = sceneId` for compatibility.
  - `chapterId` — chapter identifier (string). Optionally set `chapter = chapterId` for compatibility.
- Backend tolerance (unchanged):
  - Create/Update accepts `sceneId` or (fallback) `id` as key; requires a chapter (`chapterId` preferred; `chapter` accepted).
  - Server persists request JSON verbatim in `data` column (naive parser for a few fields).
- Guidance for external clients (e.g., loke-graph):
  - When POST/PUT scenes: include both `sceneId` and `id` (same value); include both `chapterId` and `chapter` (same value) to be future‑proof.
  - When GET scenes: prefer `sceneId`/`chapterId`; if absent, fallback to `id`/`chapter`.
  - Existing datasets with `{ id, chapter }` remain valid; no migration required.

### Fixed

- Scenes losing chapter reference in lists and editor
- Edit scene clearing Scene ID when changing chapter
- StatusPill now reflects backend availability automatically (and shows pending count)
- Data backfill (dev only): Updated `server/dev.db` scenes to include `sceneId=id`, `chapterId=chapter01` and a default `sceneText` to ensure consistent editing and graph rendering.

### Phase 6 - Polish & Hardening - 2025-10-20

### Added

- Global toast notifications with accessible, animated container
  - `src/stores/toast.js`, `src/components/ToastContainer.vue`
- Skeleton loaders for lists
  - `src/components/BaseSkeletonList.vue` used in Scene/Chapter lists
- Dev error overlay + error monitor hardened
  - `src/components/DevErrorOverlay.vue`, `src/plugins/error-monitor.ts` (ESM + TS)
- TypeScript in sensitive areas (navigation)
  - Router typed: `src/router/index.ts`, `src/router/typed.ts`
  - Header typed breadcrumbs: `src/components/AppHeader.vue`
  - Runtime route guards for lists: `src/router/guards.js`
  - TS config: `tsconfig.json`; tooling scripts: `check:types`, `check:types:watch`
  - Navigation stability spec: `tests/navigation-stability.spec.js`

### Fixed - Graph App (`apps/graph`)

- Fixed critical startup crash: `GlobalGraph.vue` missing `<script setup>` tag
- Fixed CSS imports: Changed `vue-flow` to `@vue-flow` prefix for correct module resolution
- Removed invalid `@vue-flow/background/dist/style.css` import (file doesn't exist in package)
- Fixed `ThemeToggle.vue` import path in `GraphAppHeader.vue` (adjusted for Vite root)
- Fixed orphan SQLite records breaking Vue Flow rendering
  - Store now filters out position-only records without valid `sceneId`
  - Added null check: `if (!id || id === 'undefined') return null`
  - Filter results: `.filter(Boolean)` to remove nulls from arrays
- Fixed Vue Flow not rendering visually
  - Added missing `@vue-flow/core/dist/theme-default.css` import
  - Changed `fit-view` prop to `fit-view-on-init` (correct Vue Flow prop)
  - Fixed layout: changed `App.vue` main from `overflow-auto` to `overflow-hidden`
  - Changed graph containers from fixed height to `h-full` for proper flexbox sizing
  - Added explicit `.vue-flow-container { width: 100%; height: 100%; }` CSS
- Fixed orphan scenes issue: created missing `chapter01` in database (all 4 scenes reference it)
- Graph nodes now check if parent chapter exists before setting `parentNode` relationship
- **VERIFIED WORKING**: Playwright tests confirm 7 nodes render on Global Graph, 4 on Chapter Graph
- Graph app fully functional at http://localhost:8092

### Changed

- Page transitions: unified route transition around `RouterView` (no Suspense)
- Scenes ⇄ Dashboard stability: removed page transition to eliminate out-in race; breadcrumbs now path-based; Dashboard recent scenes filtered; guards applied
- Scene/Chapter lists: robust links via guards; filter invalid scene entries
- Settings/Editors: inline status banners removed in favor of toasts
- Dev orchestration: `dev:full:watch` runs only frontend + backend (Graph runs with `dev:graph`)
  - Starts TypeScript typecheck watcher in background

### Fixed

- Error monitor no longer throws in browser (removed CommonJS require)
- Missing route params are guarded at compile‑time and runtime (typed router + guards)

### Removed

- Legacy vanilla JS no longer used (to avoid DOM/nav conflicts)
  - `src/components/{Navigation,Layout,Sidebar,SceneEditor,CodePreview}.js`, `src/lib/state.js`

### Phase 5 - Graph App (Two‑App Design) - 2025-10-20

### Added

- Two‑app architecture
  - `loke-cards` (main app): forms, CRUD, codegen, settings, E2E flows
  - `loke-graph` (external app): visual graph (Vue Flow) — fully decoupled
- Standalone Graph app (separate Vue 3 + Vue Flow app)
  - Location: `apps/graph`
  - Dev: `npm run dev:graph` (http://127.0.0.1:8092)
  - Build/Preview: `npm run build:graph`, `npm run preview:graph`
  - Routes: `/` (GlobalGraph), `/chapter/:id` (ChapterGraph)
- Copied graph code into NodeView for independent evolution
  - Components: `apps/graph/src/graph/components/GlobalGraph.vue`, `ChapterGraph.vue`
  - Node components: `apps/graph/src/graph/components/nodes/SceneNode.vue`, `ChapterNode.vue`
  - Builders/Layout/Types: `apps/graph/src/graph/*` (ELK browser bundle)
  - Store/API/Local storage: `apps/graph/src/graph/stores/graph.js`, `apps/graph/src/graph/api/client.js`, `apps/graph/src/graph/lib/storage.js`
- Dev orchestration
  - `scripts/dev-full-watch.sh` now also launches Graph app on `VITE_GRAPH_PORT` (default 8092) with hot reload
  - Root scripts: `dev:graph`, `build:graph`, `preview:graph`

### Design

- Separation of concerns
  - Main app (`loke-cards`) focuses on data entry, lists, editors, codegen and settings
  - Graph app (`loke-graph`) focuses on the Twine‑style graph, layouts and visual flows
- Runtime & styling
  - The graph app imports `src/styles/main.css` for consistent styling (Tailwind)
  - Each app has its own LocalForage namespace (loke‑cards vs loke‑graph)
- API & offline
  - Both apps talk to the same backend via `/api` or `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
  - Both apps fall back to LocalForage when backend is offline (health‑gated requests)

### Changed

- Router stability: eager-loaded primary views, keyed RouterView with Suspense fallback; removed NodeView routes from main app; `/nodes` removed/redirected
- Breadcrumbs now validate route params before linking (avoid missing required param "id")
- ELK import switched to browser bundle (`elkjs/lib/elk.bundled.js`) to avoid web-worker resolution errors
- Removed invalid deep CSS import for `@vue-flow/background`
- API client now short-circuits when backend is offline to avoid Vite proxy error spam
- Header/Sidebar z-index increased to avoid overlap with NodeView canvas

### Added (Dev Quality)

- In-app error monitor (dev only): `src/plugins/error-monitor.js`, `src/components/DevErrorOverlay.vue`, `src/stores/debug.js`
  - Captures Vue errors, unhandled rejections, window errors, and router errors
- Playwright specs
  - `tests/navigation-sidebar.spec.js` — Sidebar navigation updates views and asserts no console errors (NodeView scenario removed)

### Notes

- Graph app falls back to LocalForage when backend is offline; edges derive from `choices[].nextScene`. NodeView/Graph link removed from main sidebar (open the external app instead).

### Migration

- Use `npm run dev:full:watch` to launch both apps + backend (ports: 8081, 8092, 3000)
- Open Graph app at http://127.0.0.1:8092 (or set `VITE_GRAPH_PORT`)
- Any previous links to `/nodes` in the main app have been removed; use the external app directly

### Cleanup

- Removed legacy vanilla JS files no longer used by the Vue app:
  - `src/components/Navigation.js`, `Layout.js`, `Sidebar.js`, `SceneEditor.js`, `CodePreview.js`
  - `src/lib/state.js`
- This eliminates potential DOM-manipulating code paths that could conflict with Vue Router navigation.
- Connecting two scene nodes in NodeView persists a new choice on source scene (LocalForage + best-effort API)

### Phase 4 - E2E Test Suite Optimization - 2025-10-20

- ✅ Passing: 34 tests
- ⏭️ Skipped: 15 tests (deprecated/debug/not-implemented)
- ❌ Failed: 1 test (scene-crud - API timing issue)

**Known Issues:**

- `scene-crud.spec.js`: Scene not appearing in list after save (backend API propagation delay)
- Backend `/api/scenes/:id/code` endpoint returns "Scene not found" for all scenes

### Phase 3 - Dev Backend Integration - 2025-10-19

### Added

  - File manager (server/src/file_manager.cpp) - Manages project/chapter/scene structure
  - REST API with 8 endpoints (health, projects, chapters, scenes)
  - Test scene generated and verified: `projects/test-adventure/chapter01/forest_entrance.c`
- Configured ESLint and Prettier for Vue.
- Added a basic Playwright test script.

### Fixed

- Vite dev server port to 8081 to match Tailscale proxy configuration.

**Decision: Rewrite with Vue 3 + C++ Backend**

After completing Phase 0-2 with Vanilla JavaScript, we encountered fundamental issues:

- Hot reload inconsistent with dynamic Tailwind classes in JS
- Sidebar component visibility problems
- Manual DOM manipulation became unmaintainable
- Difficult debugging without framework devtools

**New Technology Stack:**

- Frontend: Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind + Pinia + Vue Router
- Backend: C++ with httplib + SQLite (replacing localStorage/LocalForage)
- Testing: Playwright CLI for browser automation
- No localhost URLs - Tailscale serve only

**Branches:**

- `vanilla-js-backup` - Preserved original work
- `vue-rewrite` - New Vue 3 implementation (current)
- `dev` - Original development branch

**Migration Files:**

- `TODO.md` - Now deprecated, points to TODO-VUE.md
- `TODO-VUE.md` - Complete Vue 3 migration plan (20-27 hours)
