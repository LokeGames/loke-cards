# Changelog

All notable changes to Loke Cards will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Refactoring - 2025-10-21
- **Project Restructuring (Phase 1):** (Gemini)
  - Restructured the project into a monorepo-like layout to prepare for Svelte migration.
  - Created `cards-vue`, `graph-vue`, and `shared-vue` directories.
  - Relocated the main Vue application source from the root (`src/`, `tests/`, `index.html`) into the `cards-vue` directory.
  - Relocated the graph application from `apps/graph` into the `graph-vue` directory.
  - Cleaned up the root directory by removing the now-obsolete `src/`, `apps/`, and `tests/` folders.

### Planning
- Reorder roadmap: Phase 7 → PWA Offline‑First + Sync; Phase 8 → Deployment
- Add SYNC design doc: `doc/SYNC-DESIGN.md` (single‑user LWW, push/pull deltas)
 - Projects layer: introduce `projectStore` + `ProjectPicker` (single active project)

### Phase 7 - Offline‑First Bootstrap - 2025-10-20

### Added
- Sync heartbeat that live‑checks backend health every 2s and updates UI
  - `src/plugins/sync-heartbeat.js`, wired from `src/main.js`
- Network toggle for manual Online/Offline simulation (persists in `localStorage`)
  - `src/components/NetworkToggle.vue`; placed next to `StatusPill`
- Sync store with basic states: `synced`, `syncing`, `idle`, `offline`, `error`
  - `src/stores/syncStore.js` and `StatusPill` wiring with pending count
- Service Worker scaffold (app‑shell/runtime caching; prod/preview only)
  - Registration in `src/main.js`; worker in `public/sw.js`
- Playwright scaffold for offline app‑shell navigation (skipped until finalized)
  - `tests/offline-sync.spec.js`
- Reactive data stores (live UI updates)
  - `src/stores/scenes.js` and `src/stores/chapters.js` as single source of truth (Pinia)
  - Lists and editors bind to store state; background refresh replaces content only if non-empty
  - Event bus for cross-tab updates: `src/lib/events.js`, wired in `src/lib/storage.js`
- DB adapter + WASM path
  - `src/lib/db/` with `getDb()` switchable between LocalForage and SQL.js (WASM); Worker-capable
  - SQL.js OPFS persistence (autosave + manual flush), Settings UI to switch and migrate

### Changed
- API client normalization and canonical data shape
  - Scenes now normalized to a single shape in the app: `sceneId` (primary id), `id` mirrors `sceneId`, `chapterId` holds chapter reference
  - `api.scenes.getAll/getById` return normalized objects; `api.chapters.getAll` normalized as well
  - `api.scenes.create/update` accept canonical fields and add `id`/`chapter` aliases for backend compatibility
  - Central normalizers added: `src/lib/normalize.js`
  - App consistency updates using canonical fields
  - Editor/List/Dashboard/Graph use `sceneId` and `chapterId` exclusively in UI and logic
  - Removed ad‑hoc normalization in views; rely on API client/utility normalizers
  - Graph app aligned: API client and store now normalize to canonical `sceneId`/`chapterId` (internal `id` mirrors `sceneId`)
  - Scene/Chapter lists and Dashboard now use stores and update live without reload
  - Settings exposes Database Backend controls and migration utility
  - Scene/Chapter lists and Dashboard now use stores and update live without reload

### Upcoming — Projects (Single Active Project)
### Added
- `projectStore` (planned): holds `currentProject`, list, CRUD; persists selection in `localStorage`.
- `ProjectPicker` (planned): header/sidebar dropdown for selecting the active project; Settings for project management.

### Changed
- Scope all Cards views (lists, editors) and operations by `projectId` (planned migration of existing data to `projectId: 'default'`).
- API: include optional `projectId` filter and payload fields; keep backward compatible.
- Graph app uses the same project context as Cards (viewer role):
  - Reads active `projectId` (shared key or API param) and only displays that project’s chapters/scenes.
  - No independent project selection in Graph when embedded; follows Cards.

### Database/API compatibility (IDs)
- No server DB schema changes in this phase (still: `chapters(id TEXT, data TEXT)`, `scenes(id TEXT, data TEXT)`).
- Canonical scene shape for clients (recommended):
  - `sceneId` — primary scene identifier (string). Also set `id = sceneId` for compatibility.
  - `chapterId` — chapter identifier (string). Optionally set `chapter = chapterId` for compatibility.
- Backend tolerance (unchanged):
  - Create/Update accepts `sceneId` or (fallback) `id` as key; requires a chapter (`chapterId` preferred; `chapter` accepted).
  - Server persists request JSON verbatim in `data` column (naive parser for a few fields).
- Guidance for external clients (e.g., loke-graph):
  - When POST/PUT scenes: include both `sceneId` and `id` (same value); include both `chapterId` and `chapter` (same value) to be future‑proof.
  - When GET scenes: prefer `sceneId`/`chapterId`; if absent, fallback to `id`/`chapter`.
  - Existing datasets with `{ id, chapter }` remain valid; no migration required.

### Fixed
- Scenes losing chapter reference in lists and editor
- Edit scene clearing Scene ID when changing chapter
- StatusPill now reflects backend availability automatically (and shows pending count)
 - Data backfill (dev only): Updated `server/dev.db` scenes to include `sceneId=id`, `chapterId=chapter01` and a default `sceneText` to ensure consistent editing and graph rendering.

### Phase 6 - Polish & Hardening - 2025-10-20

### Added
- Global toast notifications with accessible, animated container
  - `src/stores/toast.js`, `src/components/ToastContainer.vue`
- Skeleton loaders for lists
  - `src/components/BaseSkeletonList.vue` used in Scene/Chapter lists
- Dev error overlay + error monitor hardened
  - `src/components/DevErrorOverlay.vue`, `src/plugins/error-monitor.ts` (ESM + TS)
- TypeScript in sensitive areas (navigation)
  - Router typed: `src/router/index.ts`, `src/router/typed.ts`
  - Header typed breadcrumbs: `src/components/AppHeader.vue`
  - Runtime route guards for lists: `src/router/guards.js`
  - TS config: `tsconfig.json`; tooling scripts: `check:types`, `check:types:watch`
  - Navigation stability spec: `tests/navigation-stability.spec.js`

### Fixed - Graph App (`apps/graph`)
- Fixed critical startup crash: `GlobalGraph.vue` missing `<script setup>` tag
- Fixed CSS imports: Changed `vue-flow` to `@vue-flow` prefix for correct module resolution
- Removed invalid `@vue-flow/background/dist/style.css` import (file doesn't exist in package)
- Fixed `ThemeToggle.vue` import path in `GraphAppHeader.vue` (adjusted for Vite root)
- Fixed orphan SQLite records breaking Vue Flow rendering
  - Store now filters out position-only records without valid `sceneId`
  - Added null check: `if (!id || id === 'undefined') return null`
  - Filter results: `.filter(Boolean)` to remove nulls from arrays
- Fixed Vue Flow not rendering visually
  - Added missing `@vue-flow/core/dist/theme-default.css` import
  - Changed `fit-view` prop to `fit-view-on-init` (correct Vue Flow prop)
  - Fixed layout: changed `App.vue` main from `overflow-auto` to `overflow-hidden`
  - Changed graph containers from fixed height to `h-full` for proper flexbox sizing
  - Added explicit `.vue-flow-container { width: 100%; height: 100%; }` CSS
- Fixed orphan scenes issue: created missing `chapter01` in database (all 4 scenes reference it)
- Graph nodes now check if parent chapter exists before setting `parentNode` relationship
- **VERIFIED WORKING**: Playwright tests confirm 7 nodes render on Global Graph, 4 on Chapter Graph
- Graph app fully functional at http://localhost:8092

### Changed
- Page transitions: unified route transition around `RouterView` (no Suspense)
- Scenes ⇄ Dashboard stability: removed page transition to eliminate out-in race; breadcrumbs now path-based; Dashboard recent scenes filtered; guards applied
- Scene/Chapter lists: robust links via guards; filter invalid scene entries
- Settings/Editors: inline status banners removed in favor of toasts
- Dev orchestration: `dev:full:watch` runs only frontend + backend (Graph runs with `dev:graph`)
  - Starts TypeScript typecheck watcher in background

### Fixed
- Error monitor no longer throws in browser (removed CommonJS require)
- Missing route params are guarded at compile‑time and runtime (typed router + guards)

### Removed
- Legacy vanilla JS no longer used (to avoid DOM/nav conflicts)
  - `src/components/{Navigation,Layout,Sidebar,SceneEditor,CodePreview}.js`, `src/lib/state.js`

### Phase 5 - Graph App (Two‑App Design) - 2025-10-20

### Added
- Two‑app architecture
  - `loke-cards` (main app): forms, CRUD, codegen, settings, E2E flows
  - `loke-graph` (external app): visual graph (Vue Flow) — fully decoupled
- Standalone Graph app (separate Vue 3 + Vue Flow app)
  - Location: `apps/graph`
  - Dev: `npm run dev:graph` (http://127.0.0.1:8092)
  - Build/Preview: `npm run build:graph`, `npm run preview:graph`
  - Routes: `/` (GlobalGraph), `/chapter/:id` (ChapterGraph)
- Copied graph code into NodeView for independent evolution
  - Components: `apps/graph/src/graph/components/GlobalGraph.vue`, `ChapterGraph.vue`
  - Node components: `apps/graph/src/graph/components/nodes/SceneNode.vue`, `ChapterNode.vue`
  - Builders/Layout/Types: `apps/graph/src/graph/*` (ELK browser bundle)
  - Store/API/Local storage: `apps/graph/src/graph/stores/graph.js`, `apps/graph/src/graph/api/client.js`, `apps/graph/src/graph/lib/storage.js`
- Dev orchestration
  - `scripts/dev-full-watch.sh` now also launches Graph app on `VITE_GRAPH_PORT` (default 8092) with hot reload
  - Root scripts: `dev:graph`, `build:graph`, `preview:graph`

### Design
- Separation of concerns
  - Main app (`loke-cards`) focuses on data entry, lists, editors, codegen and settings
  - Graph app (`loke-graph`) focuses on the Twine‑style graph, layouts and visual flows
- Runtime & styling
  - The graph app imports `src/styles/main.css` for consistent styling (Tailwind)
  - Each app has its own LocalForage namespace (loke‑cards vs loke‑graph)
- API & offline
  - Both apps talk to the same backend via `/api` or `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
  - Both apps fall back to LocalForage when backend is offline (health‑gated requests)

### Changed
- Router stability: eager-loaded primary views, keyed RouterView with Suspense fallback; removed NodeView routes from main app; `/nodes` removed/redirected
- Breadcrumbs now validate route params before linking (avoid missing required param "id")
- ELK import switched to browser bundle (`elkjs/lib/elk.bundled.js`) to avoid web-worker resolution errors
- Removed invalid deep CSS import for `@vue-flow/background`
- API client now short-circuits when backend is offline to avoid Vite proxy error spam
- Header/Sidebar z-index increased to avoid overlap with NodeView canvas

### Added (Dev Quality)
- In-app error monitor (dev only): `src/plugins/error-monitor.js`, `src/components/DevErrorOverlay.vue`, `src/stores/debug.js`
  - Captures Vue errors, unhandled rejections, window errors, and router errors
- Playwright specs
  - `tests/navigation-sidebar.spec.js` — Sidebar navigation updates views and asserts no console errors (NodeView scenario removed)

### Notes
- Graph app falls back to LocalForage when backend is offline; edges derive from `choices[].nextScene`. NodeView/Graph link removed from main sidebar (open the external app instead).

### Migration
- Use `npm run dev:full:watch` to launch both apps + backend (ports: 8081, 8092, 3000)
- Open Graph app at http://127.0.0.1:8092 (or set `VITE_GRAPH_PORT`)
- Any previous links to `/nodes` in the main app have been removed; use the external app directly

### Cleanup
- Removed legacy vanilla JS files no longer used by the Vue app:
  - `src/components/Navigation.js`, `Layout.js`, `Sidebar.js`, `SceneEditor.js`, `CodePreview.js`
  - `src/lib/state.js`
- This eliminates potential DOM-manipulating code paths that could conflict with Vue Router navigation.
- Connecting two scene nodes in NodeView persists a new choice on source scene (LocalForage + best-effort API)

### Phase 4 - E2E Test Suite Optimization - 2025-10-20

### Test Results
**34/36 tests passing (94.4%)**
- ✅ Passing: 34 tests
- ⏭️ Skipped: 15 tests (deprecated/debug/not-implemented)
- ❌ Failed: 1 test (scene-crud - API timing issue)

**Known Issues:**
- `scene-crud.spec.js`: Scene not appearing in list after save (backend API propagation delay)
- Backend `/api/scenes/:id/code` endpoint returns "Scene not found" for all scenes

### Phase 3 - Dev Backend Integration - 2025-10-19

### Added
- SQLite-backed dev API for local testing (`server/main.cpp`)
  - Tables: `chapters(id,data)`, `scenes(id,data)` in `server/dev.db`
  - Endpoints: `GET /api/health`, `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/chapters`, `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/scenes`, `GET /api/scenes/:id`, `GET /api/chapters/:id`
- Build endpoint: `POST /api/build` writes generated `.c` files to `server/output/`
- Build endpoint now also writes chapter headers (`<chapter>.h`) with forward declarations
- Build artifacts endpoint: `GET /api/build/artifacts` lists generated `.c` and `.h` files
- Server-side codegen now parses basic choices/stateChanges from JSON (naive parser)
- Scene Editor: Local/Server code preview toggle; server code generated on demand

**Decision: Rewrite with Vue 3 + C++ Backend**

After completing Phase 0-2 with Vanilla JavaScript, we encountered fundamental issues:
- Hot reload inconsistent with dynamic Tailwind classes in JS
- Sidebar component visibility problems
- Manual DOM manipulation became unmaintainable
- Difficult debugging without framework devtools

**New Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind + Pinia + Vue Router
- Backend: C++ with httplib + SQLite (replacing localStorage/LocalForage)
- Testing: Playwright CLI for browser automation
- No localhost URLs - Tailscale serve only

**Branches:**
- `vanilla-js-backup` - Preserved original work
- `vue-rewrite` - New Vue 3 implementation (current)
- `dev` - Original development branch

**Migration Files:**
- `TODO.md` - Now deprecated, points to TODO-VUE.md
- `TODO-VUE.md` - Complete Vue 3 migration plan (20-27 hours)

  - Lists and editors bind to store state; background refresh replaces content only if non-empty
  - Event bus for cross-tab updates: `src/lib/events.js`, wired in `src/lib/storage.js`
